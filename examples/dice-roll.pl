In this example, we get the dice number and faces number in Dungeons and
Dragons notation: I<NkF>, where I<N> is the number of dice and I<F> in the
number of faces on each dice.

Each dice is held in its own superposition, we entangle them into a single
system with addition, and then we "throw" them by calling C<collapse> on the
entire system.
