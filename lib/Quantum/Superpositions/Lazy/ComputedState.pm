=head1 NAME

Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy::ComputedState - a weighted state implementation
with the source of the computation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of L<Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy::State> with extra fields
that allow tracking of the computation sources that produced the state. Objects
of this class are produced inside the
L<with_sources|Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy/with_sources> block.

=head1 METHODS

All of the methods available in L<Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy::State>, plus:

=head2 operation

Instance of a class consuming the
L<Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy::Role::Operation> role. This can be helpful to
determine what kind of operation was performed to obtain the state.

=head2 source

An array reference of state values that were used in the operation (in order).
The number of elements in the arrayref will depend of the operation type.
