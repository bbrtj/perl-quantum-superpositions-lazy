=head1 NAME

Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy::State - a weighted state implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple implementation of a state that contains a weight and a value.
The states are meant to be immutable, so once created you cannot change the
value or weight of a state (without cloning it).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

	my $state = Quantum::Superpositions::Lazy::State->new(
		weight => 2,
		value => "on"
	);

A generic Moose constructor. Accepts two arguments: I<weight> of numeric type
(positive), which is optional and 1 by default, and I<value> of any type
(defined), which is required.

=head2 weight

Returns the weight.

=head2 value

Returns the value.

=head2 reset

Resets the state of a superposition inside of the I<value> attribute, if that
value is indeed a superposition.

=head2 clone

Creates a new state with the parameters of the current one.

=head2 clone_with

	# doubles the weight on the cloned state
	$state->clone_with(weight => sub { shift() * 2 });

Clones the objects with I<clone> and then applies some transformators on top of
the object fields.

=head2 merge

Merges two states into one. Only possible for values that are the same
(compared as strings with I<eq>). The weights are added together on the
resulting state.
